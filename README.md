### Trivia Game
    This game begins when the user clicks start. The 30 second countdown begins and they are tasked 
    with answering questions about films. They have a total of 4 choices. If they do not select an answer after 30 seconds it will wait 3 seconds and then continue to the next question and add to their no answer counter. If they get the question right, it will say, "You got it correct!" and display an image related to the answer. If they get it wrong, it will say "You got it wrong, the correct answer is + correctAnswer". After each question answered or not answered, it waits 3 seconds and then continues to the next question. At the end the users score will be displayed.
